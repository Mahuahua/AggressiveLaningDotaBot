# AggressiveLaningDotaBot
An attempt to use default bot heroes differently at laning pharse

Being more aggressive means that more damage is dealt, so that the "offensive score" will be super high

This would make bot make smarter decisions (as they finally have more ratings for themselves!)

All panic and misclicks of my own gameplay will also be simulated....
